        <li><strong>Deal posture:</strong> Is this initiative structurally ready for a capital, procurement, or strategic partnership decision — now?</li>

    <!-- STRUCTURAL CONDITION -->
    <section class="home-section section-tint section-tint-b" id="structure">
      <div class="section-head">
        <h2>Structural condition</h2>
        <p class="section-sub muted">Why this instrument exists.</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        In contemporary innovation ecosystems, deals rarely fail because of technological insufficiency.
        They fail because decision-grade artifacts were not composed before scrutiny arrived.
        Market logic remains narrative, financial framing remains provisional, and risks remain implicit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Governance bodies increasingly require structural coherence before committing capital or institutional capacity.
        The constraint has therefore moved upstream.
        Readiness must now be composed before negotiation, not during remediation.
      </p>

      <p>
        This instrument exists to surface structural deficits early, while commitments remain reversible and sequencing can still be corrected.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- INPUTS / OUTPUTS -->
    <section class="home-section section-tint section-tint-a">
      <div class="section-head">
        <h2>Inputs and outputs</h2>
        <p class="section-sub muted">Interface-level description only.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Inputs</h3>
      <p>
        Structured claims regarding stage evidence, pathway assumptions, market positioning, preliminary financial parameters, regulatory context, stakeholder landscape, and declared constraints.
        Inputs are treated as provisional until evidenced.
      </p>

      <h3>Outputs</h3>
      <p>
        Composed decision artifacts: a market study summary, a financial projection summary, and a structured risk register, accompanied by a readiness exposure view that identifies sequencing gaps and coordination assumptions.
        These artifacts are designed for governance use, not internal reassurance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- INTERPRETATION RULES -->
    <section class="home-section section-tint section-tint-b">
      <div class="section-head">
        <h2>Interpretation rules</h2>
        <p class="section-sub muted">How outputs should be read.</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Outputs are exposure markers, not certifications.
        A high-readiness signal indicates artifact density and sequencing coherence.
        It does not indicate inevitability of success.
      </p>

      <p>
        A low-readiness signal indicates that a capital or partnership decision would rely on narrative rather than structure.
        In such cases, the appropriate response is not acceleration, but composition.
      </p>

      <p>
        The instrument therefore changes the governing question from
        “Is this attractive?”
        to
        “Is this structurally defensible under scrutiny?”
      </p>

        <h2>Validity conditions</h2>
        <p class="section-sub muted">When this instrument is valid — and when it is not.</p>

      <ul class="article-list">
        <li><strong>Valid when:</strong> a deal decision is approaching and artifact coherence is required.</li>
        <li><strong>Invalid when:</strong> used as a marketing badge, reputational signal, or substitute for formal due diligence.</li>
        <li><strong>Condition of validity:</strong> inputs must reflect current evidence and declared constraints; suppressed risks invalidate outputs.</li>
        <li><strong>Failure mode prevented:</strong> capital committed to initiatives whose internal structure cannot withstand external scrutiny.</li>
