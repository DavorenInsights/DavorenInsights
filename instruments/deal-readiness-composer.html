          <h3>Artifact deficit precedes deal failure</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            In contemporary innovation ecosystems, deals are rarely blocked by technical novelty. They stall because decision-grade artifacts were never composed in time: structured market logic, defensible financial framing, explicit risk registers, and sequenced ownership of constraints.
            The constraint has moved upstream. Governance bodies now require artifact coherence before committing resources.
          </p>
          <p class="academy-note">
            This instrument exists to prevent late-stage deal collapse caused by missing structure rather than missing ambition.

          <h3>Readiness is compositional</h3>

            A high-readiness signal does not certify success. It indicates that required artifacts exist, constraints are surfaced, and sequencing is explicit.
            A low-readiness signal indicates that capital or partnership decisions would currently rely on narrative rather than structure.

        <li><strong>Failure mode prevented:</strong> capital committed to initiatives whose internal structure cannot withstand external scrutiny.</li>
