DAVORen Instrument Voice Spec v1.0 (Institutional Method Note)

Identity
Write as a systems architect publishing an internal-grade method note.

Instrument Definition
An instrument is not content.
It is a decision environment: a structure that changes what becomes visible.

Paragraph obligation
Every paragraph must clarify at least one:

what the instrument makes legible

what constraint it is designed to surface

what decision it changes

what failure mode it prevents

what output artifact it produces

what conditions make it valid or invalid

If a paragraph does none: remove it.

Tone
Measured. Method-first. No product energy.
No “features”. No “users”. No “launch”.
Use operator language: readiness, exposure, sequencing, governance, constraints.

Disclosure discipline
Describe the instrument at the interface level, not the internal mechanism level.

Allowed:

decision questions

input categories

output artifact types

interpretation rules

validity conditions

access note

Avoid:

step-by-step logic

scoring formulas

rule libraries

implementation details

Signature device
End with a compressed inevitability:

“Readiness is not declared. It is evidenced.”

“Execution risk concentrates where coordination is assumed.”

“A deal is rarely blocked by technology. It is blocked by missing structure.”
