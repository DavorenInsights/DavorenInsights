        <h2 id="obs-title">Observation</h2>
        <p>
          Across sectors, constraint is moving from episodic disruption to persistent design condition.
          Energy, water, grid capacity, permitting, capital cost, and skilled labor are binding simultaneously.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is structurally changing is not the existence of limits, but their position.
          Constraint now shapes architecture before scale, not after it.
          Systems that once optimized for peak performance under abundance are redesigning for throughput under limits.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section" aria-labelledby="mech-title">
        <h2 id="mech-title">Mechanism</h2>
        <p>
          Constraint compresses redesign cycles.
          It exposes waste, forces trade-offs, and collapses optionality.
          When optionality collapses, sequencing becomes decisive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Organizations that internalize constraint early redesign deliberately.
          Those that delay absorb coordination debt later — in rushed retrofits, supplier fragility, and stalled deployment.
          Constraint does not create innovation. It selects which architectures remain viable under scale.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section" aria-labelledby="imp-title">
        <h2 id="imp-title">Strategic implication</h2>
        <p>
          Constraint is directional intelligence.
          Design for it early and system architecture stabilizes.
          Design for abundance and constraint returns as forced correction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The relevant test is structural: can the system operate when limits are enforced by price, policy, or physical saturation?
          If not, scale is deferred redesign.
        </p>
