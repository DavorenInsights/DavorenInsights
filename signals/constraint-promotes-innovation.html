        <h2 id="obs-title">Observation</h2>
        <p>
          Across sectors, some of the most consequential innovations are emerging not from unconstrained
          possibility but from systems operating closer to their limits. Pressures related to energy,
          materials, water, and infrastructure are reshaping how technologies are designed and deployed,
          pushing organizations to rethink architectures, supply chains, and operating models.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section" aria-labelledby="int-title">
        <h2 id="int-title">Interpretation</h2>
        <p>
          Innovation is often associated with abundance — more capital, computing power, and technological
          capability. Yet structural pressure tends to reorganize systems more decisively than abundance.
          Constraints expose inefficiencies, challenge legacy assumptions, and force alternative designs
          into view.
        </p>
        <p>
          This shows up in energy-aware computing, grid-conscious industrial planning, and manufacturing
          approaches shaped by resource availability. Even semiconductor fabrication, long optimized for
          scale, is adapting to water and energy considerations, prompting advances in recycling,
          efficiency, and facility design.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section" aria-labelledby="imp-title">
        <h2 id="imp-title">Strategic implication</h2>
        <p>
          Organizations that treat constraint as directional intelligence — rather than friction to be
          bypassed — gain early advantage. Designing for limits accelerates differentiation, while
          reliance on unconstrained scaling is becoming a progressively fragile strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firms and regions that anticipate systemic pressure will be better positioned than those
          forced into late adaptation once physical realities impose higher coordination costs.
