      <!-- Signals can be observation-led. Keep it clean. -->
      <section class="article-section" aria-labelledby="obs-title">
        <h2 id="obs-title">Observation</h2>
        <p>
          Across sectors, constraints are moving from background noise to first-order design inputs.
          Energy, water, materials, grid capacity, permitting, and skills are increasingly the bottleneck.
          When the bottleneck hardens, architectures change.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not “new.” What is new is where the constraint sits: closer to the core of the operating model.
          It now shapes hardware, facilities, supply chains, and deployment sequencing—before scale is reached.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section" aria-labelledby="mech-title">
        <h2 id="mech-title">Mechanism</h2>
        <p>
          Constraint does three things fast: it exposes waste, forces trade-offs, and collapses optionality.
          That compression shortens redesign cycles. It also reveals which assumptions were only valid under abundance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pattern repeats: the system stops optimizing for peak performance and starts optimizing for throughput under limits.
          That is where “innovation” becomes visible—often as boring changes that compound: efficiency, reuse, routing, and simplification.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section" aria-labelledby="imp-title">
        <h2 id="imp-title">Strategic implication</h2>
        <p>
          Treat constraint as directional intelligence. Design for it early. Build around it deliberately.
          If you don’t, the constraint returns later as coordination debt: rushed retrofits, fragile suppliers, and stalled adoption.
        </p>
        <p>
          The practical test is simple: can your system perform when the constraint is enforced by prices, policy, or outages?
          If not, your “scale strategy” is just deferred redesign.
        </p>

          Constraint doesn’t block progress. It selects the architecture that survives scale.
